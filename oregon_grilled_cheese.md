# Oregon Grilled Cheese

Ideal grilling fare for vegetarians

## Ingredients

* Heavyweight bread (if you're in Portland, aim for a Grand Central sourdough)
* Cheddar slices--the sharper the better (if you're in Portland get Tillamook)
* Gruyere (stay away from Trader Joe's version, which is not very Gruyere-esque)
* Stone-ground mustard
* Tomato slices
* Fresh basil leaves (chiffonade for best results)
* Garlic powder

## Instructions

1. Wrinkle up your nose at the meat-eaters who have soiled the grill with their dead animal fat
2. Assemble ingredients as a sandwich and grill for a few minutes on both sides
3. Pairs well with rootbeer (Thomas Kemper is the best choice, with Henry Weinhard's as an acceptable substitute)
