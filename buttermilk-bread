# Buttermilk Wheat Bread

A light sandwich loaf with a buttery, slightly sweet flavor. Makes the best avocado toast.

## Ingredients

+ 2 cups buttermilk (I mixed mine from powder), at room temperature or lukewarm
+ 4 1/2 tsp yeast
+ 1 Tb salt
+ 1/4 cup honey
+ 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and enough white bread flour to make the dough come together

## Instructions

1. Dissolve the yeast in lukewarm buttermilk and beat in the honey, the first cup of whole wheat flour, and the salt. Then add the rest of the flour (the whole wheat first, then as much white as you need) to make a shaggy but workable dough. Turn out the dough on a lightly floured board.

2. Knead for a minute or two till the dough gets less shaggy, adding just enough flour to keep the dough from sticking. Then cover the dough with a dishtowel and let it rest for 10 minutes before kneading for another eight minutes or so. 

3. In an oiled bowl, let the dough rise, covered with the dishtowel, till doubled in volume. Then divide the dough in two and shape it into loaves that fit into two greased loaf pans. (I grease bread pans by making a flour/oil slurry and painting the insides of the pans with it, using a pastry brush.) Cover the loaves with the towel and let the dough rise again. 

4. When the loaves dome over the tops of the pans, slit the tops with a sharp knife or razor blade. Brush the tops with water, using a pastry brush or a scrap of paper towel dipped in water, and bake at 400 for about 35 minutes.
